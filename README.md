This project focuses on predicting the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on the current match scenario. Utilizing detailed historical data and machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, the project aims to provide accurate predictions that can be valuable for enthusiasts, analysts, and stakeholders.

## Features

Key features engineered and utilized in the modeling process include:

- **Current Score**: Total runs scored by the batting team at the current point in the match.
- **Overs Completed**: Number of overs bowled.
- **Wickets Fallen**: Number of wickets lost by the batting team.
- **Runs Remaining**: Runs needed by the batting team to win.
- **Balls Remaining**: Balls left in the innings.
- **Current Run Rate (CRR)**: Runs scored per over till the current point.
- **Required Run Rate (RRR)**: Runs required per over to win.
- **Team Encodings**: Representing teams in a numerical format suitable for modeling.

## Machine Learning Model

 **Logistic Regression**:
   - A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
   - Suitable for binary classification tasks like predicting win or loss.
